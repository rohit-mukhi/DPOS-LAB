To create the heirarchy I did the following:

$: mkdir DOS_2341013419
$: cd DOS_2341013419
$: mkdir DOS_ass_1
$: cd DOS_ass_1
$: mkdir dir_1


To make another directory while in DOS_ass_1 I did the following

$: mkdir dir_2

Now to delete the dir_2 while in DOS_2341013419 I did the following

$: sudo rm -rf DOS_ass_1/dir_2

To display the inode values of all file in a directory I did the following;
